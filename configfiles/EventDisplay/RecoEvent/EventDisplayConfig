# EventDisplay config file

Event -999		#use -999 if want to loop over all events in file, otherwise the specific event number (0 ... N_events - 1)
Mode Charge		#select Display Mode (Charge / Time)
EventType RecoEvent	#choose Store format to read from. ANNIEEvent: Use MCHits/MCLAPPDHits variables & the true MCParticles variables, RecoEvent: use the RecoStore and the associated charge and time information in the Digitized Hits
EventList None 		#/ANNIECode/ToolAnalysis/exemplary_event_list.dat #to be used with Event -999
SelectedEvents 1	#show only events for which the EventSelector cuts were passed
Threshold_Charge 1	#choose threshold for events in charge (lower limit)
Threshold_ChargeLAPPD 1.		#same as threshold, but for LAPPDs
Threshold_TimeLow -10	#for time, use lower and upper limits, use -999 if min and max values should be taken from data
Threshold_TimeHigh 40
TextBox	1		#choose if TextBox with information about run & event should be displayed (0: not shown, 1: shown)
LAPPDsSelected 1	#if true, only the LAPPDs specified in LAPPDsFile will be used in the analysis. If false, all LAPPD hits will be displayed 
LAPPDsFile LAPPDIDs.txt	#specify the LAPPD IDs that are active (one ID per line) 
DrawVertex 1		#true vertex is drawn
DrawRing 1		#true expected ring distribution is drawn
SavePlots 1		#decide whether to save plots as png/root or not
OutputFormat root	#options: root/image
HistogramPlots 1	#decide whether histogram plots (charge/time) are shown in addition to EventDisplay
MarkerSize 2		#size of PMT circles (default: 2)
UserInput 0		#If true, manually decide if next event shown
Graphics 0		#should a TApplication be launched?
OutputFile evdisplay_beam_muon_RecoEvent_EventSelector_DigitThr10
DetectorConfiguration ANNIEp2v6	#specify the detector configuration used in the simulation (options e.g. ANNIEp2v2, ANNIEp2v4, ANNIEp2v6)
IsData 0		#are we evaluating a data file? (0: MC, 1: data)
