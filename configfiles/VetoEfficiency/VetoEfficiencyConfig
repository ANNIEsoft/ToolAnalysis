# selection criteria for coincident events between upstream veto layer
# and some downstream component, to select through-going muons
# we always require at least one hit on the upstream veto layer,
# but can then require coincidence with a tank event, defined by:
min_unique_water_pmts 10
# and
min_tank_charge 0.5  # units nC
# or we can require coincidence with an MRD event, defined by:
min_mrdl1_pmts 1
# and
min_mrdl2_pmts 1

# these coincidences must occur within a time window of:
coincidence_tolerance 200  # units ns
# with the window start defined by the time of the earliest hit
# in the upstream veto layer, with a pre-trigger of:
pre_trigger_ns 0   # units ns, POSITIVE

# specify, or use 'auto' to derive from input filename
# e.g. if input is RAW
outputfilename auto
