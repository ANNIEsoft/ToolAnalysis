# TankCalibrationDiffuser configuration file

The TankCalibrationDiffuser toolchain currently contains the following tools:
* `LoadWCSim`
* `TankCalibrationDiffuser`

This only produces the histograms associated with the MCTruth variables from the simulation. For a more fully implemented toolchain that also includes histograms for the `ADCRecoHits` variables, refer to the `PhaseIIHitLoader` toolchain, which also contains the simulation of PMT pulses and subsequent pulse hit finding procedure.
