TO change input file:
1) it must be changed in RawLoaderConfig
2) it must be changed in ccdatafiles file (in ToolAnalysis directory)
3) the beam fetch times or the beamchecker file must be changed!

if using hefty mode data, you need to pass it a Hefty timing file, generated from the entire run (all subruns and parts needed) using one of jonathan's interpolation python scripts.

moflaher: The DAQ SQL page tells me there was only one subrun, but there's 26 part files... so i can't really tell if thats as many as there were... 
sjg: That's about the going rate if I remember correctly.

I have a bunch of pre-made timing files in `/pnfs/annie/scratch/users/gardiner/hefty_timing/`
Which reminds me, I should move those to persistent before long
If you want to make them yourself, here's the procedure:
1. `cd` to a folder where you have write permission
2. `source /cvmfs/annie.opensciencegrid.org/annietools/setup_timing.sh`
3. `timing.py RUN_NUMBER .`
The third step will write all of the timing files for that run into the current directory
You can see the syntax for using my `timing.py` script by executing it without any arguments
