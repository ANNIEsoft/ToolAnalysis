\hyperlink{classEventSelectorDoE}{Event\-Selector\-Do\-E}

\subsection*{Data}

The event selector tool flags events in the input data file as passing or failing various event selection criteria. Current event selection flags that can be utilized include\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item M\-C\-Truth\-Cut\-: Flags M\-C muon events generated within a defined radius and height, and requires a non-\/zero track length on the Muon
\item Prompt\-Trig\-Only\-: Flags any event with M\-C\-Triggernum $>$ 0. For the Do\-E files, this is true for all events since only prompt info was stored
\end{DoxyItemize}

For each event, all cuts defined with the config file are checked. If the event passes all cuts, Event\-Cut\-Status is set to true and saved to the Reco\-Event store. If any cut fails, Event\-Cut\-Status is set to false.

Eventually, this tool will also add a bit mask to the Reco\-Event store telling which Cuts were checked when the \hyperlink{classEventSelectorDoE}{Event\-Selector\-Do\-E} tool was run. The bitmask will have bits filled as defined below in the configuration (first cut defined -\/$>$ least significant bit).

\subsection*{Configuration}

Configurables tell \hyperlink{classEventSelectorDoE}{Event\-Selector\-Do\-E} which cuts to run/check when defining the master Event\-Cut\-Status bit checked by all following tools

``` verbosity bool M\-C\-Truth\-Cut (1 or 0) Prompt\-Trig\-Only (1 or 0) ```
