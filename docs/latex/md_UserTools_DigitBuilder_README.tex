Interface

\subsection*{Data}

This tool is responsible for loading hit information from the A\-N\-N\-I\-E\-Event store and converting them to Reco\-Digits. Reco\-Digits are the standard hit format used by all tools in the reconstruction chain.

By default, all individual P\-M\-T true hit times and charges (with time smeared in W\-C\-Sim) are loaded into a \hyperlink{classRecoDigit}{Reco\-Digit}. True \hyperlink{classLAPPD}{L\-A\-P\-P\-D} hit times, with a 100 ps time smearing, are loaded.

\subsection*{Configuration}

Describe any configuration variables for Interface.

``` Parametric\-Model bool

If this bool is set to 1, the P\-M\-T parametric model of hits is used to fill Reco\-Digits. To form a P\-M\-T parametric model hit, the following process is performed for a P\-M\-T\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Gather all true hits on the P\-M\-T in the current event.
\item The parametric hit time is taken as the median of all hit times.
\item The parametric hit charge is taken as the sum of all hit charges.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Photo\-Detector\-Configuration string This configuration is used to decide what digit types are loaded into Reco\-Digits and used for reconstruction. Options are (L\-A\-P\-P\-D\-\_\-only, P\-M\-T\-\_\-only, or All)
