#----- Tool: DNNTrackLength -----

This tool contains python scripts for:
i)  the reconstruction of the track length in the water tank - DNNFindTrackLengthInWater.py
ii) It uses .csv files created by "FindTrackLengthInWater" and creates .csv to be used at the enery reconstruction. 
iii)Change input filenames at:
    #--- evts for training:
    infile = "../LocalFolder/NEWdata_forRecoLength_9_10MRD.csv"
    #--- evts for prediction:
    infile2 = "../LocalFolder/NEWdata_forRecoLength_0_8MRD.csv"
iv) the output file is: vars_Ereco.csv 

This script needs to use: python/3.7.0/bin/python3
Commands and packages needed to be installed: 
yum -y install python-matplotlib (3.0.0 )
yum -y install python-pip 

pip install numpy (1.15.2)
pip install pandas (0.23.4)
pip install tensorflow (0.12.0)
pip install sklearn (0.20.0)
pip install root_numpy (4.7.3.dev0)

#--- Description of the methods:
* Training and test samples must be different to avoid biases and overtraining
* enter the event file names in infile variable to reconstruct the track length in the water tank
