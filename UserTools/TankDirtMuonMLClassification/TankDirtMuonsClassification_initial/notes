* quickanalysis_ANNIEratpac.C: reads the ratpac simulation output file and creates a .csv file with these variables:
particlePDGCode, trueKineticEnergy, vertexX,vertexY,vertexZ,numberofPEs, and pmt x position pmt y position, pmt z position,pmt timing  for all hits.

In this Ratpac version: 
-> For the particle's position:  z direction is the beam axis and y is the detector height. 
          		     The center (0,0,0) is at the veto.

-> For the PMT positions: z is the vertical axis (height) and y is the beam axis BUT the direction of y is reverse to the beam.

* read_csv.py: reads the csv file and generates some example plots.

* Classifier.py: reads the .csv and classifies dirt from tank muons.  

* plot_confusion_matrix.py: reads the predictionsKeras.csv and plots the confusion matrix 

Note: these results have been using a quick ratpac simualtion. They need to be confirmed with the full ANNIE simulation and FMV.
