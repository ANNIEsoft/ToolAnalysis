#----- Tool: EnergyReco -----

This tool contains python scripts for:
i)  the muon energy reconstruction - BDT_MuonEnergyReco.py
ii) the neutrino energy reconstruction - BDT_NeutrinoEnergyReco.py

This script needs to use: python/3.7.0/bin/python3
Commands and packages needed to be installed: 
yum -y install python-matplotlib (3.0.0 )
yum -y install python-pip 

pip install numpy (1.15.2)
pip install pandas (0.23.4)
pip install tensorflow (0.12.0)
pip install sklearn (0.20.0)
pip install root_numpy (4.7.3.dev0)

#--- Description of the methods:
* Training and test samples must be different to avoid biases and overtraining
* The input files for each script can be changed in the beginning of each file: 
   #--- evts for training:
   infile = "../LocalFolder/vars_Ereco.csv"
   #--- evts for prediction:
   infile2 = "../LocalFolder/vars_Ereco.csv"
   #----------------
* These files can reproduce the results of the DOE proposal.
* Due to lack of available statistics at the time, we used the same file, then split the sample in half and used different event samples for training/testing and different events for prediction/energy reconstruction. 

* TO DO:
  The aim is to use a large datasample for training/testing and fine-tune the algorithm. Then the prediction will be in collected data.
