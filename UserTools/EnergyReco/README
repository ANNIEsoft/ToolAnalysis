#----- Tool: EnergyReco -----

This tool contains python scripts for:
i)  the muon energy reconstruction - BDT_MuonEnergyReco.py
ii) the neutrino energy reconstruction - BDT_NeutrinoEnergyReco.py

Commands and packages needed to be installed: 
yum -y install python-matplotlib
yum -y install python-pip 

pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install tensorflow
pip install sklearn
pip install root_numpy

#--- Description of the methods:
* Training and test samples must be different to avoid biases and overtraining
* The input files for each script can be changed in the beginning of each file: 
   #--- evts for training:
   infile = "../LocalFolder/vars_Ereco.csv"
   #--- evts for prediction:
   infile2 = "../LocalFolder/vars_Ereco.csv"
   #----------------
* These files can reproduce the results of the DOE proposal.
* Due to lack of available statistics at the time, we used the same file, then split the sample in half and used different event samples for training/testing and different events for prediction/energy reconstruction. 

* TO DO:
  The aim is to use a large datasample for training/testing and fine-tune the algorithm. Then the prediction will be in collected data.
