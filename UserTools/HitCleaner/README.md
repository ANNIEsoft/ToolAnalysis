# HitCleaner

The `HitCleaner` tool cleans up events by selecting only digits that are above a certain threshold, have a certain number of neighbouring hits or are clustered with other digits.

## Input

`HitCleaner` uses `RecoDigit` objects that have been generated by the `DigitBuilder` tool.

**RecoDigit** `vector<RecoDigit>`
* Loops over the digits and checks whether digits fulfill certain conditions (space/time/pulse threshold).

## Output

`HitCleaner` returns the input vector of `RecoDigit` objects, but with an adjusted `isFiltered` status flag. Those digits that passed the cuts have a `isFiltered` flag of 1, while the ones that did not pass the cut have a flag of 0.

**RecoDigit** `vector<RecoDigit*>*`
* Collection of `RecoDigits` with their filter status flag set.

The tool furthermore stores the hit cleaning parameters in the `RecoEvent` store:

**HitCleaningParameters** `map<string,double>`
* Map containing the Hit Cleaning parameters

It also stores the information about found hit cleaning clusters:

**HitCleaningClusters** `vector<RecoCluster>`
* The found clusters are stored in the form of a vector.

## Configuration

HitCleaner can be configured in the following way:
