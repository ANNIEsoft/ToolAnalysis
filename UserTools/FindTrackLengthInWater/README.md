FindTrackLengthInWater

* Takes the .root file from reconstruction (e.g. reco26_5LAPPDs+128PMTs_extv3_9.root), calculates the track length as the distance between the first and last Cherenkov photon emission point along the track and stores variables for track length reconstruction using DNN in a .csv file. 
* Set input/output file names at: configfiles/FindTrackLengthInWater/LoadRecoInputFile
