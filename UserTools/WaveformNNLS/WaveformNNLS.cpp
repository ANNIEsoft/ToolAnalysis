/*
This tool is a waveform processing tool that uses the Lawson and Hanson 
non-negative least squares deconvolution algorithm to find signals 
with a known "template" in a noisy waveform. The libraries found
in this tool directory are taken from: http://suvrit.de/work/soft/nnls.html 

The algorithm numerically solves the matrix equation Ax = b by
minimizing 0.5*|Ax - b|^2 . In the context of a template fit, 
the matrix A represents information about the template, b is 
a vector form of the noisy waveform where the vector index is a time
index, and x is a "solution vector". Each row of A is a time series
(indexed by the column) that is a template waveform. Subsequent rows of
A have the template waveform shifted in time by one sample. Therefore, each 
element of solution vector "x" represents how many template waveforms should
be placed at a particular index in time. The sum of all such components is 
the final fitted solution, A*x . 

Expects raw data, named in the config file, of the form map<int, vector<Waveform<double>>>.
Expects a template that is a TH1D coming from a root file. The template often has a much
higher sampling rate than the raw data. This algorithm can handle that and can use it as
extra information. There is a parameter "samplingFactor" that controls how to up/downsample
the template and raw data so that they match timescales. A list of sample times is also
needed to place the solution components in the correct position relative to the rawdata
time-series.
